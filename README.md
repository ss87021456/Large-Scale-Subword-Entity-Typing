# To-Do List
- [ ] Revise the input arguments of separate modules to achieve better modularity
- [ ] Merge some modules or modulize some frequently used methods
- [ ] Use utf-8 encoding for future support multi-languages
- [ ] Pipelining the processes 
- [ ] Documentation on all methods
- [ ] Documentation on separate works 
- [X] Remove LateX commmands in volcabulary list
- [ ] Find ways or algorithms for detecting and expanding acronyms that followed immediately after the full name
- [ ] Add scipts for processing the dataset
- [ ] (TBD)


# Known Issues:
- [ ] Volcabulary list generation threading issue: Unknown cause to join threads

# Optimization on code
- [ ] Bugs on displaying tqdm, consider to write progressbar manually
- [ ] Better threading code structure
- [ ] Writing result to file might consume too much memory on larger dataset
