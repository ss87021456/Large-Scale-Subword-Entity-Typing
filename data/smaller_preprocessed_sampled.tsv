26151966 Psychometric Properties of the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale among a Multiethnic Population during Pregnancy. The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) was developed to measure maternal attitudes toward infant feeding, but a number of validated studies on the IIFAS found that it was subject to methodological limitations.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IIFAS among a multiethnic population in Singapore.A cross-sectional research design was used on a sample of 417 antenatal women. The internal consistency and stability of the IIFAS were evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability. Known-group comparisons discriminated certain group differences in a predictable way. A series of exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) was conducted to test the factor structure of the IIFAS using the maximum likelihood and principal axis factoring. The number of factors was selected according to theoretical and statistical considerations. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was further performed to validate the factor structure constructed in the prior EFA.The IIFAS had a Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation of 0.79 and 0.85, respectively. The known-group comparisons among certain groups were supported. The EFA results showed that the 3-factor structure produced the most interpretable and theoretical sense. A second-order CFA was conducted to confirm the construct dimensionality of the 15-item IIFAS, with satisfactory fit indices found.The 15-item IIFAS is a psychometrically sound measurement tool that health care professionals can use to understand the diverse infant feeding attitudes and knowledge among different ethnic groups in order to provide breastfeeding interventions that are culturally sensitive.
26151965 The Ability of Posters to Enhance the Comfort Level with Breastfeeding in a Public Venue in Rural Newfoundland and Labrador. The acceptance and support of breastfeeding in public venues can influence breastfeeding practices and, ultimately, the health of the population.The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether posters targeted at the general public could improve acceptability of breastfeeding in public places.A convenience sample of 255 participants was surveyed at shopping centers in 2 rural communities of Newfoundland and Labrador. Experimentally, questions were posed to 117 participants pre- and post-exposure to 2 specific posters designed to promote public acceptance of breastfeeding in public.Initially, we surveyed that only 51.9% of participants indicated that they were comfortable with a woman breastfeeding anywhere in public. However, context played a role, whereby a doctor's office (84.5%) or park (81.4%) were the most acceptable public places for breastfeeding, but least acceptable was a business office environment (66.7%). Of participants, 35.4% indicated previously viewing specific posters. We used a visual analog scale to test poster viewing on the acceptability of public breastfeeding in the context of a doctor's office and a restaurant. Results of pre- versus post-viewing of the promotional posters indicated significant improvements in both scenarios: in a doctor's office (P = .035) and in a restaurant (P = .021).Nearly 50% of the surveyed population indicated discomfort with a mother breastfeeding in public. Both cross-sectional and interventional evidence showed that posters significantly improved the reported level of comfort toward seeing breastfeeding in public.
26151955 Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey. Very few women become interventional cardiologists, although a substantial proportion of cardiologists and the majority of medical students are women. In accordance with the EAPCI Women Committee mission of attaining gender equality at the professional level, a worldwide survey was recently conducted aiming to understand better the motivations and the barriers for women in selecting interventional cardiology (IC) as a career path.A total of 1,787 individuals (60.7% women) responded to the survey. Women compared to men were less frequently married (women vs. men, 57.0% vs. 79.8%, p&lt;0.001) and more frequently childless (46.6% vs. 20.5%, p&lt;0.002). The most prevalent reason for choosing IC was passion (83.3% vs. 76.1%, p=0.12), while those for not choosing were, sequentially, lack of opportunity (29.0% vs. 45.7%), radiation concerns (19.9% vs. 11.6%) and preference (16.2% vs. 29.5%), p&lt;0.001. According to 652 men replying to why, in their opinion, women do not choose IC, on-calls and long working hours were the most frequent reasons (35.3%).Several barriers preclude women from choosing IC, including lack of opportunity, concerns regarding radiation exposure and the prejudices of their male colleagues. This highlights the need to develop new strategies for future training, education, and support of women in order to choose IC.
26151954 Bioabsorbable vascular scaffold overexpansion: insights from in vitro post-expansion experiments. While bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) are increasingly used in clinical practice, their behaviour when post-dilated beyond their recommended maximum overexpansion diameter remains sparsely documented. We aimed to test the overexpansion of the BVS scaffold in vitro and evaluate the impact of excessive scaffold oversizing on focal point support.We examined the post-expansion behaviour of the bioresorbable vascular scaffold (3.0 mm and 3.5 mm Absorb BVS; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) after overexpansion with non-compliant (NC) balloons of increasing diameters. After each oversizing step, the scaffolds were measured and inspected for strut disruption using microscope and optical coherence tomography imaging. Point force mechanical measurements on single scaffold struts were also performed to evaluate the impact of excessive scaffold overstretching on focal mechanical support. 3.0 mm and 3.5 mm scaffold sizes could be post-expanded up to 1 mm above their nominal diameters without any strut fracture when deployed without an external constraining model. Importantly, when overexpansion of both scaffold sizes was repeated using a constraining silicone lesion model, only post-expansion with an NC balloon size 0.5 mm larger than the scaffold nominal sizes could be performed without strut fractures. Point force compression analysis on single struts shows that overstretched struts with fractures provided lower focal strength compared to overexpanded ring segments without fractures and normal segments expanded at nominal pressure.In our experiments, only overexpansion with an NC balloon 0.5 mm larger than the BVS size was feasible for BVS deployed inside an arterial lesion model. Overexpansion of the BVS scaffold beyond recommended post-dilation limits can lead to strut disconnections and focal loss of mechanical support.
26151953 First Lotus aortic valve-in-valve implantation to treat degenerated Mitroflow bioprostheses. Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation is an emerging alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with degenerated aortic bioprostheses. This procedure presents a high risk of coronary occlusion, especially during treatment of patients implanted with a bioprosthesis with a lower distance between the leaflets and the coronary ostia, such as the Mitroflow valve (Sorin S.p.A., Milan, Italy). In this report we aim to describe the safety and feasibility of transfemoral valve-in-valve implantation of a new-generation LotusTM Aortic Valve Replacement System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) in a case of degenerated Mitroflow bioprostheses.We describe a case of degenerated Sorin Mitroflow bioprostheses successfully treated with the transfemoral new-generation Lotus valve-in-valve system. During the procedure no coronary protection was required and the patient had no MACE at 30-day follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Lotus valve implant in a degenerated Mitroflow prosthesis.The transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure using the new-generation Lotus Valve System is a safe and feasible alternative to repeat cardiac surgery in high-risk patients with surgical degenerated Mitroflow bioprostheses.
26151952 Effects of Arsenite Exposure during Fetal Development on Energy Metabolism and Susceptibility to Diet-Induced Fatty Liver Disease in Male Mice. Chronic exposure to arsenicals, at various life stages and across a range of exposures, has been implicated in cardiometabolic disease and liver disease, but disease predisposition from developmental exposures remains unclear.In utero and post-weaning As (III) exposure was examined on the background of a Western diet to determine whether As (III) affects metabolic disease.Male Swiss Webster mice were exposed to 100 ppb As (III) in utero, after weaning, or both. Ad libitum access to a Western diet was provided after weaning, and the plasma metabolome, liver histopathology, liver enzyme activity, and gene expression were analyzed.Hepatic lipid composition and histopathology revealed that developmental As (III) exposure exacerbated Western diet induced fatty liver disease. Continuous As (III) exposure increased cardiometabolic risk factors including increased body weight, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and plasma triglycerides. As (III) affected a decrease in the intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, while increasing ketones. Hepatic isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was also decreased, which confirms disruption of the TCA cycle. Developmental As (III) increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis, inflammation, and packaging of triglycerides suggesting increased Acetyl-CoA load.In utero and continuous early life exposure to As (III) disrupted normal metabolism and elevated the risk for fatty liver disease in mice maintained on a high fat diet. Our findings suggest that individuals exposed to As (III) during key developmental periods, and who remain exposed to As (III) on the background of a Western diet, may be at increased risk of metabolic disease later in life.
26151951 Traffic-Related Air Pollution and Parkinson's Disease in Denmark: A Case-Control Study. Very little is currently known about air pollutants' adverse effects on neurodegenerative diseases even though recent studies have linked particulate exposures to brain pathologies associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and Parkinson's disease.In a case-control study of 1,696 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients identified from Danish hospital registries and diagnosed 1996-2009 and 1,800 population controls matched by gender and year of birth we assessed long-term traffic-related air pollutant exposures (NO2) from a dispersion model, using residential addresses from 1971 to the date of diagnosis or first cardinal symptom for cases and the corresponding index date for their matched controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with logistic regression adjusting for matching factors and potential confounders.We found ambient air pollution from traffic sources to be associated with risk of PD, with a 9% higher risk (95% CI: 3, 16.0%) per interquartile range increase (2.97 mug/m(3)) in modeled NO2. For participants living for 20 years or more in the capital city odds ratios were larger (OR= 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.31) than in provincial towns (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.26), while there was no association among rural residents.Our findings raise concerns about potential effects of air pollution from traffic and other sources on the risk of PD, particularly in populations with high or increasing exposures.
26151950 Thyroid Antagonists (Perchlorate, Thiocyanate, and Nitrate) and Childhood Growth in a Longitudinal Study of U.S. Girls. Perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate are sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) inhibitors that block iodide uptake into the thyroid, thus affecting thyroid function. Thyroid dysfunction can adversely affect somatic growth and development in children. To our knowledge, no studies have examined effects of NIS inhibitors on body size measures.We investigated associations between NIS inhibitors and childhood growth in 940 girls from the Puberty Study of the Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program.Urine samples collected from girls 6-8 years of age at enrollment (2004-2007) from New York City, greater Cincinnati, Ohio and the Bay Area in California were analyzed for NIS inhibitors and creatinine (C). The longitudinal association between NIS inhibitors and anthropometric measures (height, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI)) during at least 3 visits was examined using mixed effects linear models, adjusted for race and site.Compared to girls in the low exposure group (3.6, 626 !g/gC and 500 mg/gC, median, perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate, respectively) girls with the highest NIS inhibitor exposure (9.6, 2343 !g/gC and 955 mg/gC, median perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate, respectively) had slower growth in waist circumference and BMI but not height. Significant differences in the predicted mean waist circumference and BMI between the low and high exposure groups were observed beginning at 11 years of age.Higher NIS inhibitor exposure biomarkers were associated with reductions in waist circumference and BMI. These findings underscore the need to assess exposure to NIS inhibitors with respect to their influence on childhood growth.
26151949 Identifying (Quasi) Equally Informative Subsets in Feature Selection Problems for Classification: A Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy Approach. An emerging trend in feature selection is the development of two-objective algorithms that analyze the tradeoff between the number of features and the classification performance of the model built with these features. Since these two objectives are conflicting, a typical result stands in a set of Pareto-efficient subsets, each having a different cardinality and a corresponding discriminating power. However, this approach overlooks the fact that, for a given cardinality, there can be several subsets with similar information content. The study reported here addresses this problem, and introduces a novel multiobjective feature selection approach conceived to identify: 1) a subset that maximizes the performance of a given classifier and 2) a set of subsets that are quasi equally informative, i.e., have almost same classification performance, to the performance maximizing subset. The approach consists of a wrapper [Wrapper for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (W-QEISS)] built on the formulation of a four-objective optimization problem, which is aimed at maximizing the accuracy of a classifier, minimizing the number of features, and optimizing two entropy-based measures of relevance and redundancy. This allows conducting the search in a larger space, thus enabling the wrapper to generate a large number of Pareto-efficient solutions. The algorithm is compared against the mRMR algorithm, a two-objective wrapper and a computationally efficient filter [Filter for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (F-QEISS)] on 24 University of California, Irvine, (UCI) datasets including both binary and multiclass classification. Experimental results show that W-QEISS has the capability of evolving a rich and diverse set of Pareto-efficient solutions, and that their availability helps in: 1) studying the tradeoff between multiple measures of classification performance and 2) understanding the relative importance of each feature. The quasi equally informative subsets are identified at the cost of a marginal increase in the computational time thanks to the adoption of Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine as global optimization and learning algorithms, respectively.
