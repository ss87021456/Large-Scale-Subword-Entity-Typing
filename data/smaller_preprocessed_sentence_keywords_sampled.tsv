26151966 Psychometric Properties of the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale among a Multiethnic Population during Pregnancy.	Pregnancy	Ion	Iowa	Infant
The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) was developed to measure maternal attitudes toward infant feeding, but a number of validated studies on the IIFAS found that it was subject to methodological limitations.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IIFAS among a multiethnic population in Singapore.A cross-sectional research design was used on a sample of 417 antenatal women.

The internal consistency and stability of the IIFAS were evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability.	RNA	Liability
Known-group comparisons discriminated certain group differences in a predictable way.	Paris
The number of factors was selected according to theoretical and statistical considerations.	Ion	Id	F Factor
A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was further performed to validate the factor structure constructed in the prior EFA.The IIFAS had a Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation of 0.79 and 0.85, respectively.	Ear	Ion	Id	Factor Analysis
The known-group comparisons among certain groups were supported.	Paris
A second-order CFA was conducted to confirm the construct dimensionality of the 15-item IIFAS, with satisfactory fit indices found.The 15-item IIFAS is a psychometrically sound measurement tool that health care professionals can use to understand the diverse infant feeding attitudes and knowledge among different ethnic groups in order to provide breastfeeding interventions that are culturally sensitive.
