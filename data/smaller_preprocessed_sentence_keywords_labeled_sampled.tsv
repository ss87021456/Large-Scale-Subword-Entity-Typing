The residues of 13 antibiotics (4 quinolones, 3 sulfonamides, 2 tetracyclines, 2 amphenicols, 1 macrolides, and trimethoprim) and 7 sex hormones (4 endogenous sex hormones and 3 synthetic sex hormones) were detected by the isotope dilution method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in visceral organs and muscles of crabs.A total of 7 antibiotics were detected in visceral organs or muscles of crabs, including 3 quinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enrofloxacin), 3 sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethoxazole) and trimethoprim.	1364	3277	27232

For the global view, a dual-cube constraint model and Bundle Adjustment algorithm (BA) are incorporated to deal with the mosaicking error caused by the irregular inflation and non-rigid deformation of the stomach.	11595	11599	8153	13175
The 54-year-old patient, missing the right mandibular second bicuspid, first molar, and second molar, had her atrophic ridge augmented with a 30:70 mixture of autogenous bone and equine, enzyme-deantigenic collagen-preserved bone substitute.	8701	19864	24793	4735	4746	3053	8734
Here we reported the age wise mean values and standard deviations for each compound, adjusted for creatinine content (mmol/mol of creatinine).	4751	12099	12101	2568	12900	6229

Through two case studies of Catholic parishes in Massachusetts, this study explores the implications of leader-centered versus distributed leadership in Catholic parishes for the implementation of evidence-based health interventions.	1364	3277	9325	14890	12176
The goal of this multi-institutional collaboration was to develop an innovative, locally relevant ethics curriculum for nurses in Botswana.	10722	10720	803	804	808	3413
In this cultivar, the downregulation of cly1 is unrelated to miR172-directed mRNA degradation, but rather is caused by an epiallele that represses transcription.	8701	5860	13398	22410
A method for detecting NAT2 in immune cells using flow cytometry was developed.	8701	19864	1362	10165	4427
This paper summarizes available data in the literature about informed consent for research involving patients suffering from schizophrenia.	21276	15747	23298	23297	23302

Those who had blister pack missing or empty and the caretaker did not report administering all the doses at the correct time and amount were considered probably non-adherent or as probably adherent when the caretaker reported administering all doses at the correct time and amount.	3180	7727	19070	19071	23908	23917	23932
The difference of indicators at different time points in inlet and outlet such as blood glucose, free-calcium, and lactate was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05), but the difference in indicators such as pH, PvCO2, PvO2, potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate was not statistically significant (P ;0.05).During HP treatment, the indicators of blood glucose, free-calcium and lactate were significantly affected by HP cartridge, and the effect varies with time.	3038	3197	3809	4751	8382	13265	15876	15878
